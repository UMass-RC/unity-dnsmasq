# unity-dnsmasq
DNSMasq configuration from dns.unity.rc.umass.edu:/etc/

There is no git repo initialized in /etc/. We could make a github account for root@unity, upload an ssh key (not the actual root key of course), and `git push` by root from /etc/, but it's ugly and it doesn't show who made what changes. Most likely going in a different direction and this can be archived.
